The following piece of code ought to do it for you. Just one thing to take care of here, make sure the .tfrecord is saved inside the testdata directory, which is inside pegasus/data/.In the gist above you will see that the targets are also passed.

        "src_text1=[ \"\"\" Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples.\"\"\",\r\n",

Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: \"For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. \"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. \"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism.\" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will \"consider all options\" for the frigates to ensure \"best financial return for the taxpayer\". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to \"commercial sensitivity\". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems. They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew. Last year, the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was sold as scrap for £3m.\"\"\",\r\n",

        "src_text2=[\"\"\"A turbocharger, colloquially known as a turbo, is a turbine-driven, forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra compressed air into the combustion chamber.[1][2] This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output is because the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone.\"\"\",\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"\"\"Turbochargers were originally known as turbosuperchargers when all forced induction devices were classified as superchargers. Today, the term \"supercharger\" is typically applied only to mechanically driven forced induction devices. The key difference between a turbocharger and a conventional supercharger is that a supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine, often through a belt connected to the crankshaft, whereas a turbocharger is powered by a turbine driven by the engine's exhaust gas. Compared with a mechanically driven supercharger, turbochargers tend to be more efficient, but less responsive. Twincharger refers to an engine with both a supercharger and a turbocharger.The 1905[4] patent by Alfred Büchi, a Swiss engineer working at Gebrüder Sulzer (now simply called Sulzer) is often considered the birth of the turbocharger.[5][6] This patent was for a compound radial engine with an exhaust-driven axial flow turbine and compressor mounted on a common shaft.[7][8] The first prototype was finished in 1915 with the aim of overcoming the power loss experienced by aircraft engines due to the decreased density of air at high altitudes.[9][10] However, the prototype was not reliable and did not reach production.[9] Another early patent for turbochargers was applied for in 1916 by French steam turbine inventor Auguste Rateau, for their intended use on the Renault engines used by French fighter planes.[7][11] Separately, 1917 testing by the American National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and Sanford Alexander Moss showed that a turbocharger could enable an engine to avoid any power loss (compared with the power produced at sea level) at an altitude of up to 4,250 m (13,944 ft) above sea level.[7] The testing was conducted at Pikes Peak in the United States using the V12 Liberty aircraft engine.[11]\"\"\",\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"\"\"The first commercial application of a turbocharger was in 1925, when Alfred Büchi successfully installed turbochargers on ten-cylinder diesel engines, increasing the power output from 1,300 to 1,860 kilowatts (1,750 to 2,500 hp).[12][13][14] This engine was used by the German Ministry of Transport for two large passenger ships called the \"Preussen\" and \"Hansestadt Danzig\". The design was licensed to several manufacturers and turbochargers began to be used in marine, railcar and large stationary applications.[10]\"\"\",\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"\"\"Turbochargers were used on several aircraft engines during World War II, beginning with the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in 1938, which used turbochargers produced by General Electric.[7][15] Other early turbocharged airplanes included the B-24 Liberator, P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt and the experimental Focke-Wulf Fw 190 prototypes.\"\"\",\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"\"\"Automobile and truck manufacturers began research into turbocharged engines during the 1950s, however the problems of \"turbo lag\" and the bulky size of the turbocharger were not able to be solved at the time.[5][10] The first turbocharged cars were the short-lived Chevrolet Corvair Monza and the Oldsmobile Jetfire, introduced in 1962.[16] Following the 1973 oil crisis and the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments, turbocharging became more common in automobiles, as a method to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.\"\"\"]"

        "              \"\"\"A turbo-charger for an internal combustion engine includes an exhaust turbine impeller which is exposed to and heated by the high temperature of engine exhaust gas passing through the turbo changer. Therefore, the shaft bearings of the turbo-charger are also heated because of the heat transmitted from the turbine impeller. A bearing housing of the turbo-charger is, therefore, usually provided with cooling water jackets in the vicinity of the turbine impeller, and when the engine is running a part of the engine cooling water is forcibly circulated therethrough to cool the bearing portions of the turbo-charger.\"\"\",\r\n",
        "              \"\"\"Namely, a cooling water passage is branched from the downstream side of a water pump to introduce the cooling water into the water jackets. Therefore, when the engine is running, the cooling water is compulsorily fed into the cooling system of the turbo-charger. However, when the engine is stopped, the performance for cooling the turbo-charger depends largely on a level at which the turbo-charger is positioned, since the bearing portions thereof are then cooled by a so-called natural or gravity circulation. Consequently, if the turbo-charger is positioned lower than the cylinder head of the engine, a natural circulation is established through conventional piping for the cooling water, which cools the the interior of the engine as well as the turbo-charger. However, if the turbo-charger is positioned higher than the engine cylinder, the cooling water may be boiled in the water jacket of the turbo-charger, thus filling the jackets with vapor (gas) which will prevent the circulation of the cooling water, when the engine is stopped after having been driven in a heavy load condition. Therefore, positioning the turbo-charger at a higher level than that of the engine with conventional piping for circulating cooling water causes an increase in the temperature of the bearing portions and a deterioration in the lubricant.\"\"\",\r\n",
